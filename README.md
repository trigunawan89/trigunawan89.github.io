### About

I am an information technology enthusiast with more than 7 years experience around data analytics solutions. I also like developing fullstack web and cloud solutions for the last 2 years. Currently working as an expert data analytic for Corporate Risk & Integrity at Sinarmas Asia Pulp & Paper. My main expertise is data engineering on top of SQL & Python ecosystem. My secondary programming skills are using Javascript, React/Vue and Django/Flask Framework to build an API and web applications. In my previous experience I worked mainly with commercial business intelligence tools, but now I usually use open source technology as my foundation to develop data analysis, machine learning, web applications and APIs. I love doing side projects in my free time to expand my software development capabilities in web, frontend, backend, devops, APIs, big data and machine learning.
