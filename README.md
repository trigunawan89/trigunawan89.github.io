### About

I'm a fullstack developer based in Jakarta, Indonesia. currently working as expert data analytics for corporate risk & integrity at Asia Pulp & Paper. My primarily technology skill set is data engineering on top of Python ecosystem. My secondary programming capabilities are with Javascript, React & Vue to build webs apps. In a past life I worked primarily with business intelligence tools, but now I typically use Python whenever I want to build a webs apps, API & data analytics solution.I love doing side project to expand my software development abilities on frontend, backend, devops and data scientist.
