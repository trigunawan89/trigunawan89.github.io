### About

I'm a fullstack & data analytics developer based in Jakarta, Indonesia. Currently working as expert data analytics for corporate risk & integrity at Asia Pulp & Paper. My primary technology skill set is data engineering on top of Python ecosystem. My secondary programming capabilities are with Javascript, React & Vue to build webs apps. In a past life I worked primarily with business intelligence tools, but now I typically use Python whenever I want to build a webs apps, API & data analytics solution. I love doing side project to expand my software development abilities on frontend, backend, dev-ops and data scientist.
